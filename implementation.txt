### TCL 7.6
# TCL 7.6 only needs 11 laws rather than 12 becasue it doesn't have the {*} argument expansion

so in total, what I will implement:
	• TCL 7.6, since it is easier and doesn't have some complicated things like {*}
	• commands, only need the ones necessary to make my game example, which will be snake
		♠ set varName ?value?
			○ Read and write variables
			○ if value exists then set varName = value, create new variable if one doesn't exist
			○ if varName has '(' and an ending ')', then create an array named varName and set the ith index to value
			○ if not in a procedure, varName is a global variable
			○ in a procedure, varName is a local variable, unless stated otherwise
		♠ uplevel (no upvar)
